### Internationalization (i18n) Implementation

#### Progress
- Completed implementation of internationalization (i18n) for the application
- Created language switcher component with proper functionality
- Implemented client-side translation using dictionary files
- Added language persistence using localStorage
- Fixed issues with hydration and language switching
- Updated all necessary documentation

#### Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Initial approach using Next.js App Router internationalization with locale in URL path was causing routing conflicts
  - **Solution:** Simplified to client-side approach using dictionary files and localStorage for persistence

- **Challenge:** Language switching was not persisting between page refreshes
  - **Solution:** Implemented localStorage to save language preference and load it on application startup

- **Challenge:** Hydration mismatch between server and client rendering
  - **Solution:** Added client-side only rendering for language switcher component using useEffect and mounted state

#### Decisions
- **Decision:** Use client-side internationalization instead of server-side
  - **Rationale:** Simplifies implementation while still meeting requirements; avoids complex routing issues

- **Decision:** Store language preference in localStorage
  - **Rationale:** Provides persistence without requiring backend storage; simple and effective approach

- **Decision:** Preload all dictionaries at startup
  - **Rationale:** Only two languages (English and Vietnamese) so bundle size impact is minimal; improves performance when switching languages

#### Code Structure
- Created `src/utils/i18n.ts` for custom hook to manage translations
- Updated `src/configs/i18n.ts` with configuration and dictionary loading
- Implemented `src/components/LanguageSwitcher.tsx` for UI
- Created comprehensive dictionary files in `src/data/dictionaries/`

#### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 2: Authentication and User Profile
- Begin implementing Supabase authentication
- Ensure all components use the i18n translation function

### Supabase Authentication Implementation

#### Progress
- Completed implementation of Supabase authentication
- Created AuthContext for managing authentication state
- Implemented Redux slice for storing user authentication data
- Updated login and registration pages with form validation
- Added error handling and loading states for authentication processes
- Implemented route protection using middleware
- Created user dropdown component with logout functionality
- Updated i18n dictionaries with authentication-related translations

#### Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge:** Integrating Supabase Auth with React Context and Redux
  - **Solution:** Created a comprehensive AuthContext that manages Supabase Auth state and dispatches actions to Redux

- **Challenge:** Form validation with proper error handling
  - **Solution:** Implemented Zod schemas for form validation with clear error messages and field-level validation

- **Challenge:** Route protection in Next.js App Router
  - **Solution:** Created a middleware that checks authentication state and redirects accordingly

- **Challenge:** Handling authentication state persistence
  - **Solution:** Utilized Supabase's built-in session management and connected it with our AuthContext

#### Decisions
- **Decision:** Use both React Context and Redux for authentication state
  - **Rationale:** React Context provides a convenient way to access authentication methods, while Redux provides global state management for user data

- **Decision:** Implement form validation using Zod
  - **Rationale:** Zod provides type-safe validation with clear error messages and integrates well with TypeScript

- **Decision:** Use middleware for route protection
  - **Rationale:** Middleware provides a centralized way to handle route protection across the application

- **Decision:** Store minimal user data in Redux
  - **Rationale:** Only store non-sensitive user data in Redux to avoid security issues

#### Code Structure
- Created `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` for authentication state management
- Created `src/redux-store/slices/authSlice.ts` for Redux state management
- Updated `src/redux-store/index.ts` to include auth reducer
- Created `src/redux-store/ReduxProvider.tsx` for Redux provider
