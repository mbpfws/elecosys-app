## Project Structure and Authentication Recommendations

Based on analysis of the current codebase and the requirements in the technical specification, we've created comprehensive recommendations for improving the project structure and authentication approach:

1. **Project Structure Recommendations** (see `docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE_RECOMMENDATIONS.md`)
   - Organize by feature for better maintainability
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Better utilize Materio UI components
   - Follow a more consistent directory structure

2. **Authentication Strategy** (see `docs/AUTHENTICATION_STRATEGY.md`)
   - Continue with Supabase Auth rather than switching to NextAuth.js
   - Implement user roles and capabilities using Supabase RLS policies
   - Extend AuthContext to include role information
   - Create role-based hooks and route protection

3. **Materio Integration Guide** (see `docs/MATERIO_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`)
   - Process for integrating Materio components
   - Key components to integrate
   - Adaptation patterns for authentication and data fetching
   - Implementation strategy with phased approach

### Implementation Status

We have successfully implemented the high-priority recommendations from the project structure and authentication documents:

1. **Project Structure Reorganization**
   - Created feature-based directory structure for better organization
   - Created component type directories (ui, forms, layout, features)
   - Updated DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md with the new structure

2. **Role-Based Authentication**
   - Extended AuthContext to include role information
   - Created useRole hook for role-based access control
   - Updated middleware for role-based route protection
   - Created SQL scripts for database schema

3. **Materio Integration**
   - Copied and adapted login page from Materio
   - Created useSettings hook for theme configuration
   - Updated i18n dictionaries with new translations

## Next Steps

The next phase of development will focus on:

1. **Review and Implement Project Structure and Authentication Recommendations**
   - Review the recommendations in the project structure and authentication documents
   - Implement high-priority recommendations
   - Establish a plan for phased implementation of remaining recommendations

2. **Phase 2: Authentication and User Profile**
   - Task 2.1: Implement Supabase Authentication (Completed)
   - Task 2.2: Implement User Profile Management

See NEXT_TASKS.md for a detailed breakdown of upcoming tasks.

## Dependencies and External Services

- **Supabase Project:** elhub (ID: jdlhleinqetwvwxbuest, Region: ap-southeast-1)
- **Vercel:** Not yet configured
- **Google Gemini API:** Configured for client-side usage

## Human Validation Points

The following aspects have been validated by human review:

- ✓ Git repository is properly set up and connected to GitHub
- ✓ Next.js project is properly set up and runs without errors
- ✓ All dependencies are properly installed and compatible
- ✓ Directory structure matches the technical specification
- ✓ Layouts and navigation are working properly
- ✓ Internationalization (i18n) is working with language switching

The following aspects need human validation:

- ⏳ Authentication flow works correctly (registration, login, logout, route protection)
- ⏳ Form validation provides clear feedback
- ⏳ Error handling for authentication processes is appropriate
