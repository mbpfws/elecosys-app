# Image Prompts for Landing Page

## 1. Hero Background Image
**File:** `/public/images/landing/hero-bg.jpg`
**Format:** JPG
**Dimensions:** 1920x1080 (16:9 aspect ratio)
**Style:** Modern, professional, educational, gradient
**Purpose:** Main background for the hero section of the landing page

**Detailed Description:**
Create a sophisticated gradient background that transitions from deep purple (#6200ea) at the top-left to vibrant blue (#2979ff) at the bottom-right. Incorporate subtle, abstract geometric patterns that suggest technology and education - like faint circuit-like lines, nodes, and subtle educational symbols (books, graduation caps). The patterns should be minimal and low-contrast (no more than 10-15% opacity) to ensure text readability. Add 3-4 floating geometric shapes (circles, hexagons) in complementary colors with subtle glow effects. The overall aesthetic should be clean, modern, and professional, suitable for an educational tech platform. The image must work well with white text overlaid on it and maintain good contrast.

2. **Main Content:** Show a writing analysis interface with:
   - An essay submission area with Vietnamese text
   - AI feedback annotations in the margin
   - Color-coded highlights for different types of feedback (grammar, vocabulary, structure)

3. **Color Scheme:** Use the platform's purple (#6200ea) and blue (#2979ff) as accent colors with a clean white background
4. **Typography:** Use a modern sans-serif font (like Roboto or Inter)
5. **Elements:** Include realistic UI elements like buttons, cards with subtle shadows, progress indicators, and icons

The interface should look sophisticated, user-friendly, and realistic - as if it's a screenshot from an actual application. Include both Vietnamese and English text to emphasize localization.
