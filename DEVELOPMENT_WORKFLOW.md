# AI-Powered Social Learning Platform - Development Workflow

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** May 2, 2025
**Project:** AI-Powered Social Learning Platform (Vietnam)

## Overview

This document outlines the development workflow for the AI-Powered Social Learning Platform project. It defines the process for planning, executing, and documenting development tasks to ensure consistency, quality, and maintainability.

## Development Methodology

We are following the Claude Task Master methodology for task management, which involves:

1. **Task Breakdown:** Breaking down development work into granular phases, tasks, and sub-tasks
2. **Task Status Tracking:** Maintaining detailed status for each task (To Do, In Progress, Blocked, Needs Review, Done)
3. **Human-in-the-Loop Validation:** Identifying checkpoints that require human review and validation
4. **Continuous Documentation:** Updating documentation with progress, decisions, and references to code changes

## Workflow Phases

### 1. Planning Phase

Before starting any development task:

1. **Task Analysis:**
   - Review the relevant sections of the Detailed Technical Specification (v0.1)
   - Reference the High-Level Plan (v1.0) for context
   - Identify dependencies and prerequisites

2. **Task Breakdown:**
   - Break down the task into specific sub-tasks
   - Define clear acceptance criteria for each sub-task
   - Identify files to be created or modified
   - Document the plan in NEXT_TASKS.md

3. **Human Confirmation:**
   - Present the plan for human review and confirmation
   - Address any questions or concerns
   - Adjust the plan based on feedback

### 2. Execution Phase

During the development process:

1. **Incremental Development:**
   - Implement one sub-task at a time
   - Follow the project's coding standards and patterns
   - Reference existing code and components where appropriate
   - Address all linter errors before moving to the next sub-task

2. **Frequent Commits:**
   - Commit code after completing each logical unit of work
   - Use descriptive commit messages that reference task IDs
   - Push commits regularly to maintain a backup

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update CODE_MODIFICATION_LOG.md with details of changes
   - Document any decisions made during implementation
   - Update CONTEXT_DIARY.md with progress and insights

4. **Checkpoint Validation:**
   - Identify points that require human validation
   - Document these points in TASK_TRACKING.md
   - Request human review when needed

### 3. Review and Testing Phase

After completing a task or significant milestone:

1. **Self-Review:**
   - Review the code for quality, performance, and security
   - Ensure all acceptance criteria are met
   - Verify that the implementation aligns with the specification

2. **Testing:**
   - Write and run automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Perform manual testing of user flows
   - Document test results and any issues found

3. **Human Testing:**
   - Identify specific areas that require human testing
   - Provide clear instructions for testing
   - Document feedback and make necessary adjustments

### 4. Completion and Documentation Phase

After successful implementation and testing:

1. **Final Documentation:**
   - Update TASK_TRACKING.md to mark tasks as completed
   - Document any deviations from the original plan
   - Update PROJECT_STATUS.md with the current project state

2. **Knowledge Transfer:**
   - Document key implementation details
   - Explain any complex logic or algorithms
   - Provide context for future development

3. **Next Steps Planning:**
   - Identify follow-up tasks or improvements
   - Update NEXT_TASKS.md with the next priorities
   - Plan the next development cycle

## Documentation Standards

### Task Tracking Document (TASK_TRACKING.md)

Format for task entries:

```markdown
### Task X.Y: [Task Name]
- **Status:** [To Do | In Progress | Blocked | Needs Review | Done]
- **Description:** [Brief description of the task]
- **Sub-tasks:**
  - [ ] Sub-task 1
  - [ ] Sub-task 2
  - ...
- **Files Created/Modified:**
  - `path/to/file1.ts`
  - `path/to/file2.tsx`
  - ...
- **Human Validation Point:** [Description of what needs to be validated]
- **Acceptance Criteria:**
  - Criterion 1
  - Criterion 2
  - ...
- **Notes:** [Additional information, decisions, challenges]
```

### Code Modification Log (CODE_MODIFICATION_LOG.md)

Format for entries:

```markdown
## [Date]

### [Feature/Task Name]

#### Files Created/Modified
- `path/to/file1.ts` - [Brief description of changes]
- `path/to/file2.tsx` - [Brief description of changes]
- ...

#### Implementation Details
- [Key implementation details]
- [Design decisions]
- [Challenges and solutions]

#### Research Notes
- [Research findings]
- [References to documentation]
- [Compatibility considerations]

#### References
- [Links to relevant documentation]
- [Links to related code]
```

### Context Diary (CONTEXT_DIARY.md)

Format for entries:

```markdown
## [Date]

### [Task/Feature Being Worked On]

#### Progress
- [What was accomplished]
- [Current status]
- [Blockers or challenges]

#### Decisions
- [Decision made] - [Rationale]
- ...

#### Next Steps
- [Immediate next steps]
- [Open questions]
```

## Tools and Practices

### Version Control (Git/GitHub)

- **Branch Strategy:** Work on the main branch for now (single developer)
- **Commit Messages:** Follow the format: `[Task ID] Brief description of changes`
- **Commit Frequency:** Commit after each logical unit of work is completed

### Code Quality

- **Linting:** Address all ESLint errors before moving to the next task
- **TypeScript:** Use proper types, avoid `any` where possible
- **Testing:** Write tests for critical functionality

### External Services

- **Supabase:** Document all schema changes and RLS policies
- **Google Gemini API:** Follow best practices for prompt engineering
- **Vercel:** Configure for deployment when ready

## Human-in-the-Loop Validation

Human validation is required at the following points:

1. **Planning Phase:** Confirm task breakdown and approach
2. **Key Implementation Milestones:** Validate critical functionality
3. **UI/UX Changes:** Review visual and interaction design
4. **Completion:** Final review before marking a task as done
